<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-html-definition-and-meaning/"target="_blank"title="this is HTML">Hypertext Markup Lnaguage(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:</p>
<img src="coding.jpg"width="450">
<p style="margin-top:50px;">Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive.
So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.</p>
